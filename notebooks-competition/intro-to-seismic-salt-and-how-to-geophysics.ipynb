You can imagine it like an ultra-sound of the subsurface. However, in an ultra-sound, we use much smaller wavelengths to image our body. Seismic data usually has wavelengths around 1m to 100m. That has some physical implications, but for now, we don't have to deal with that. It's just something to keep in mind while thinking about resolution. \n\nImaging salt has been a huge topic in the seismic industry, basically since they imaged salt the first time. The Society of Exploration geophysicist alone has over 10,000 publications with the [keyword salt](https://library.seg.org/action/doSearch?AllField=salt). Salt bodies are important for the hydrocarbon industry, as they usually form nice oil traps. So there's a clear motivation to delineate salt bodies in the subsurface. If you would like to do a deep dive, you can see [this publication](https://www.iongeo.com/content/documents/Resource%20Center/Articles/INT_Imaging_Salt_tutorial_141101.pdf)\n\nSeismic data interpreters are used to interpreting on 2D or 3D images that have been heavily processed. The standard work of [seismic data analysis](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Seismic_Data_Analysis) is open access.\nYou'll find sections on Salt in there as well (https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Salt-flank_reflections and https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Salt_flanks). The seismic itself is pretty \"old\" in the publication, and you're dealing with data that is less noisy here, which is nice.\n\n[![Seismic Data with salt CC-BY-SA Yilmaz](https://wiki.seg.org/images/1/14/Ch05_fig0-1.png)](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Salt-flank_reflections#/media/File:Ch05_fig0-1.png)\nCaption: Figure 5.0-1  Conflicting dips associated with salt flanks: (a) CMP stack without dip-moveout correction; (b) time migration of the stack in (a); (c) the stack with dip-moveout correction; (d) time migration of the stack in (c). CC-BY-SA Yilmaz.\n\nInterpretation on seismic images has long used texture attributes, to identify better and highlight areas of interest. These can be seen like feature maps on the texture of the seismic. For salt, you will notice that the texture in the salt masks is rather chaotic, where the surrounding seismic is more \"striped\". You can think of Earth as layered. Sand gets deposited on top of existing sand. In comes salt, which is behaving very much, unlike other rocks. There is an entire research branch dedicated to salt tectonics, that is the movement of salt in the subsurface. To give you the gist, these salt diapirs form from salt layers somewhere else that were under much pressure. These started to flow (behave ductile) and find a way into other layers above. I have written a bit about salt on [my blog](http://the-geophysicist.com/the-showroom-data-for-my-thesis).\n\nOne common seismic attribute is called \"chaos\" or \"seismic disorder\". So if you talk to cynic geophysicists, you'll hear \"that deep learning better outperform the Chaos attribute\". A good starting point is [this publication](http://www.chopraseismic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Chopra_Marfurt_TLE_Aug2016-LowRes.pdf).\n\nRecently, geoscience has started to adopt deep learning, and it has seen a clear boom, particularly in imaging salt. Code for automatic seismic interpretation can be found here: \n\n+ https://github.com/waldeland/CNN-for-ASI\n+ https://github.com/bolgebrygg/MalenoV\n+ https://github.com/crild/facies_net\n\nYou will notice that these solutions load a specific SEG-Y file, which luckily we don't have to bother with. TGS provided some nice PNG files instead. However, you can glean some information from them how to approach seismic data. If you find you need some geophysical helpers, you can [import Bruges](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/bruges)\n\nLet's dive in for now.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"00833d394e3069216af171fd979c814e7e1e430d","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport sys\nimport random\nimport warnings\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport cv2\n\nfrom tqdm import tqdm_notebook, tnrange\nfrom itertools import chain\nfrom skimage.io import imread, imshow, concatenate_images\nfrom skimage.transform import resize\nfrom skimage.morphology import label\n\nfrom keras.models import Model, load_model\nfrom keras.layers import Input\nfrom keras.layers.core import Lambda\nfrom keras.layers.convolutional import Conv2D, Conv2DTranspose\nfrom keras.layers.pooling import MaxPooling2D\nfrom keras.layers.merge import concatenate\nfrom keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint\nfrom keras import backend as K\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator, array_to_img, img_to_array, load_img","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0e26e21ff39e8b2afc0003fec4e4f5269f61aa4c","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set some parameters\nim_width = 128\nim_height = 128\nim_chan = 1\npath_train = '../input/train/'\npath_test = '../input/test/'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"89455be399a79910334eb76beafc40bcdab08f83"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Exploration\nLet's look at some data.
