These questions are important for tourism, city planning, and renters alike. Where do affluent tourists rent AirBnBs? What decides a good price of your flat. Where can city planners accomodate for this new development of short term rental on the market?",}

Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learning folks. It started out as a data science competition platform and has since evolved to incorporate datasets, courses, discussions, and of course notebooks. This is my place to showcase and store notebooks I made for kaggle.
