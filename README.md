Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learning folks. It started out as a data science competition platform and has since evolved to incorporate data sets, courses, discussions, and of course notebooks. This is my place to showcase and store notebooks I made for kaggle.

## Competition Notebooks

### ðŸ¥‡ Intro to seismic, salt, and how to geophysics

Geophysics competition to identify salt bodies in seismic data. The competition was hosted by the seismic contractor TGS and provided patched seismic images with varying amounts of noise. The masks were provided as pixel-encoded masks to save bandwidth. 

### ðŸ¥‡ Intro - chest xray, DICOM, viz, U-nets - full data

Medical competition to identify pneumothorax in chest X-rays. Data provided in medical DICOM format. Very large images that benefit from downsampling.

### ðŸ¥ˆ Intro to Santa's 2019: Viz, Costs -22Î¼s- and Search

Fun kaggle competition to optimize allocation for families wanting to visit Santa's workshop. Optimization challenge where the global optimum was soon found.

### ðŸ¥ˆ Exploring the ConnectX Env and Some Minimax Intro

First reinforcement learning playground using Connect 4 on Kaggle to test new environment. Agents play against each other on the leaderboard. ConnectX is usually best approach by the Negamax algorithm, a Minimax variant.

### ðŸ¥ˆ Intro to Deep Fakes, Videos and Metadata analysis

Deep Fake competition to identify visual and sound manipulation usually using GANs in video footage.

## Freestyle Exploration Notebooks
### ðŸ¥‰ The Reason We're Happy
